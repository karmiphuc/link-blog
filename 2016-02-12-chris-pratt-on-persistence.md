It's 3:20am.

I got picked up for work at 6:45am yesterday.

I'm not good with math, especially after being up for approximately 61 hours but I think I've been up for over 77 hours.

I did a table read for Guardians of the Galaxy 2 this morning and then shot all day on Passengers and just now wrapped some 144 hours later. Weirdly both films, which I'll be shooting back to back, are being shot in Atlanta at Pinewood studios. We have the best crew. Total rock stars busting their asses.

And the stuff we're shooting. My God. I can't wait for you to see it. I go back in in about 8 hours to do more. I am doing what I love. It doesn't feel like work. Even though it is. I'm having fun. I'm overcome with joy and gratitude. I felt like posting this to say to anyone out there chasing your dream...

Fifteen years ago I felt the same passion I feel today, but I had very little opportunity. I had to hustle hard and go hungry. I had to eat sardines and figure out how to get gas money.

**And I never had a plan B.**

I never stopped believing.

Ever. 

**Don't give up.**

**Apply constant pressure for as long as it takes. It will break before you do.**

Go get it.
